# PushBox – Apple TV Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 22, 2026**

## Overview

PushBox ("the App") is a Sokoban-style puzzle game developed for Apple TV. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

---

## Information We Collect

### 1. Game Progress Data
The App saves your game progress locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework, including:
- Levels completed per world
- Star ratings earned
- Push counts per level

This data is synced across your Apple devices via **iCloud / CloudKit** if you are signed in to iCloud, so your progress is preserved when switching devices. This data is associated with your Apple ID and governed by Apple's iCloud privacy practices.

### 2. In-App Purchase Data
If you purchase solution credits through the App, the transaction is processed entirely by **Apple's StoreKit framework**. We do not collect, process, or store your payment information. Purchase records (number of credits owned, solutions unlocked) are stored locally and synced via iCloud / CloudKit.

### 3. Game Center Data
The App integrates with **Apple Game Center** to provide:
- Leaderboard scores (global and per-world)
- Achievements and milestones
- Challenges

When you use Game Center features, your Game Center nickname and score data may be visible to other Game Center users according to your Game Center privacy settings. We do not directly collect or store Game Center credentials or personal information. All Game Center data is managed by Apple.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do **not** collect your name, email address, or any other contact information.
- We do **not** use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies.
- We do **not** share any data with third parties.
- We do **not** collect location data.
- We do **not** access your camera, microphone, photos, or contacts.

## Data Storage and Security

All game data is stored locally on your device and, if iCloud is enabled, synced through Apple's secure iCloud infrastructure. We do not operate any external servers and do not have direct access to your data.

## Children's Privacy

PushBox does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The App does not contain advertising and does not require account creation. Game Center usage is subject to Apple's age restrictions and parental controls.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following Apple-provided frameworks, each governed by Apple's own privacy policies:

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| iCloud / CloudKit | Sync game progress and purchases across devices |
| StoreKit | Process in-app purchases |
| Game Center | Leaderboards, achievements, and challenges |

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated date at the top of this document. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

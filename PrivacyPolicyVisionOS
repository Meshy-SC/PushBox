This game is designed to work entirely offline, so there’s no need for an internet connection—and no chance for us to snoop on your data.

Complete Confidentiality:
There’s simply no data exchange. With Push Box, what happens on your device stays on your device.
Offline Operation:
The game runs fully offline, which means there’s zero data transmission. No internet, no data logs, no stats—period.
TERMS THAT STICK

When It Starts:
This policy kicks in the moment you download and install Push Box. As nothing is tracked or stored, these terms are in effect for as long as you use the app.
Legal Stuff:
This policy is governed by the laws in your country. Any issues will be resolved under your local legal system—nothing fancy.
Your Control:
Since we don’t collect any data, you’re always in full control of your privacy. There’s no data for you to request or modify because it doesn’t exist.

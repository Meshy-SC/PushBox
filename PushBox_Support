### How is my progress saved?

Your game progress is saved automatically on your device using SwiftData. If you are signed in to iCloud, your progress syncs across all your Apple devices.

### I lost my progress. How can I recover it?

Make sure you are signed in to the same iCloud account on your device. Your progress should sync automatically. If the issue persists, try the following:
1. Close and reopen the app.
2. Restart your device.
3. Check that iCloud is enabled for PushBox in your device's Settings.
4. If the issue continues, please contact us via email with a description of the problem.

### How do in-app purchases work?

Solution credits can be purchased through the app. All transactions are processed securely by Apple via StoreKit. We do not collect or store any payment information.

### How do leaderboards and achievements work?

PushBox uses Apple Game Center for leaderboards, achievements, and challenges. Make sure Game Center is enabled in your device settings to participate.

### Can I play on multiple devices?

Yes! If you are signed in to the same iCloud account, your progress, purchases, and unlocked solutions sync across all your Apple devices — iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro.
